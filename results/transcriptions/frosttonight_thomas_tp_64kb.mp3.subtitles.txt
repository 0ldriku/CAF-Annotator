 FROST TONIGHT by EDITH M. THOMAS
 Read for Libervox.org by Thomas Peter
 APPLE GREEN WEST and an ORANGE BAR
 And the CRYSTAL EYE of a LONE ONE STAR
 And, CHILD, take the shears and cut what you will
 FROST TONIGHT, so clear and dead still
 Then I sally forth, half-sad, half-proud And I come to the velvet, imperial crowd
 The wine-red, the gold, the crimson, the pied The dahlias that reign by the garden-side
 The dahlias I might not touch till tonight A gleam of the shears and the fading light
 And I gathered them all, the splendid throng And in one great sheaf I bore them along
 In my garden of life, with its all-laid flowers I heed a voice in the shrinking hours
 FROST TONIGHT, so clear and dead still Half-sad, half-proud, my arms I fill
