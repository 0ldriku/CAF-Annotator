 the rhyme of the ancient mariner part the first
 it is an ancient mariner and he stoppeth one of three
 by thy long grace
 beard and glittering eye now wherefore stoppest thou me the bridegroom's doors 
are opened wide and i am next of kin the guests are met the feast is set mayst hear the merry din
 in he holds him with his skinny hand there was a ship quoth he hold off unhand 
me grey-beard loon eftsoons his hand dropped he
 he holds me with his glittering eye the wedding-guest stood still and listens 
like a three years child the mariner hath his will
 the wedding-guest sat on a stone he cannot choose but hear and thus spake 
on that ancient man the bright
 dark bright-eyed mariner the ship was cheered the harbour clear'd merrily did we drop below the kirk below the hill below the lighthouse-top
 the sun came up upon the left out of the sea came he and he shone bright 
and on the right went down into the sea higher and higher every day till over the mast at noon
 the wedding-guest here beat his breast for he heard the loud bassoon the wedding-guest seemed drunk good day 심илось his dear bride and the описании of her
 the bride видим
 hath paced into the hall red as a rose is she nodding their heads before her goes the merry minstrelsy the wedding guest he beat his breast yet he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the bright-eyed maronnier
 here and now the storm-blast came and he was tyrannous and strong he struck with his oar taking wings and chased south along
 with sloping masts and dipping prow as who pursued with yell and blow still treads the shadow of his foe and forward bends his head the ship drove fast loud roared the blast and southward aye we fled
 and now there came both mist and snow and it grew wondrous cold and ice massed high came floating by as green as emerald
 and through the drifts and snowy cliffs did send a dismal sheen nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken the ice was all between
 the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it cracked and
 growled and roared and howled like noises in a swound at length did cross an albatross through the fog it came as if it had been a christian soul we hailed it in god's name
 it ate the food it ne'er had eat and round and round it flew the ice did split with the thunder fit the helmsman steered us through
 and a good south wind sprung up behind and the albatross did follow and every day for food or play came to the mariner's hollow
 in mist or cloud on mast or shroud it perched for vespers nine whiles all the night through fog smoke white glimmered the white moonshine god save thee ancient mariner from the fiends that plague thee thus why look'st thou so
 with my cross-bow i shot the albatross part the second the sun now rose upon the right out of the sea came he still hid in mist
 and on the left went down into the sea the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for food or play came to the mariner's hollow mr
 and i had done an hellish thing and it would work em woe for all averred i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow ah wretch said they the bird to slay that made the breeze to blow
 nor dim nor red like god's own head the glorious sun upwrist then all averred i had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist twas right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist
 the fair breeze blew the white foam flew the furrow followed free we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea
 down dropped the breeze
 the sails dropped down twas sad as sad could be and we did speak only to break the silence of the sea all in a hottent copper sky the bloody sun at noon right up above the mast did stand no bigger than the moon
 day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted
 ocean water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink water water everywhere nor any drop to drink
 the very deep did rot o christ that ever this should be yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea
 about about in reel and rout the death-fires danced at night the water like a witch's oils burnt green and blue and white
 and some in dreams assured were of the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow and every tongue through utter drought was withered at the root we could not speak no more than if we had been choked with soot
 ah well a day what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung
 part the third there passed a weary time each throat was parched and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye when looking westward i beheld a something in the sky
 a
 at first it seemed a little speck and then it seemed a mist it moved and moved and took at last a certain shape i wist a speck a mist a shape i wist
 and still it neared and neared as if it dodged a water-sprite it plunged and tacked and veered with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could not laugh nor wail through utter drought
 out all dumb we stood i bit my arm i sucked the blood and cried a sail a sail with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call
 gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us veil without a breeze she I sent out the red horsepower strange wail without a wheeze you will find way in this valley which bade me cry so had
 the tide she steadies with upright keel the western wave was all aflame the day was well-nigh done almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun
 and straight the sun was flecked with bars heaven's mother send us grace as if through a dungeon great he peered with broad and burning face
 alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossamires
 are those her ribs through which the sun did peer as through a great
 and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that woman's mate
 her lips were red her looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the nightmare life in death was she who thickens man's blood with cold
 the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice
 the game is done i've won i've won quoth she and whistles thrice the sun's rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with far-heard whisper o'er the sea off shot the spectre bark
 we listened and looked sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my life-blood seemed to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the steersman's face
 by his lamp gleamed white from the sails the dew did drip till clomb over the eastern bar the horned moon with one bright star within the nether tip one after one by the star dogged moon too quick for groan or sigh
 rome with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropp'd down one by one the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it pass'd me by like the whizz of my cross-bow
 manifestation fourth i fear thee ancient mariner i fear thy skinny hand and thou art long and lank and brown as is the ribbed sea-sand i'm also and all my survival's bad喝
 i fear thee and thy glittering eye and thy skinny hand so brown fear not fear not thou wedding guest this body dropt not down
 alone alone all all alone alone on the wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony
 the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i
 i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gushed
 a wicked whisper came and made my heart
 as dry as dust i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet
 the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked at me had never passed away
 and an orphan's curse would drag to hell a spirit from
 one high but oh more horrible than that is the curse in a dead man's eye seven days seven nights
 i saw that curse and yet i could not die the moving moon went up the sky and nowhere did abide
 softly she was going up and a star or two beside her beams bemocked the sultry main like april
 hoarfrost spread but where the ship's huge shadow lay the charmed water burnt all way a still and awful red
 beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the water snakes they moved in tracks of shining white
 and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes within the shadow of the ship i
 watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam
 and every track was a flash of golden fire oh happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware
 sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware the self-same moment i could pray and from my neck so free the albatross fell off and sank like lead into the sea
