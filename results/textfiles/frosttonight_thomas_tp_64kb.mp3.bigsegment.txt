 FROST TONIGHT by EDITH M. THOMAS
 APPLE GREEN WEST AND AN ORANGE BAR
 AND THE CRYSTAL EYE OF A LONE ONE STAR AND, CHILD, TAKE THE SHEARS AND CUT WHAT YOU WILL
 FROST TONIGHT, SO CLEAR AND DEAD STILL THEN I SALLY FORTH, HALF SAD, HALF PROUD,
 AND I COME TO THE VELVET IMPERIAL CROWD, THE WINE RED, THE GOLD, THE CRIMSON, THE PIDE,
 THE DAHLIAS THAT RAIN BY THE GARDEN SIDE.
 THE DAHLIAS I MIGHT NOT TOUCH TILL TONIGHT,
 A GLEAM OF THE SHEARS AND THE FADING LIGHT, AND I GATHERED THEM ALL, THE SPLENDID THRONG,
 AND IN ONE GREAT SHEEF I BORE THEM ALONG.
 IN MY GARDEN OF LIFE, WITH ITS ALL LAID FLOWERS, I HEED A VOICE IN THE SHRINKING HOURS,
 FROST TONIGHT, SO CLEAR AND DEAD STILL, HALF SAD, HALF PROUD, MY ARMS I FILL.
